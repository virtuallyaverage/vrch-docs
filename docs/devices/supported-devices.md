# Supported Devices

The ecosystem was designed from the ground up for providing good support for all manner of physical haptics devices.

Any haptic device where an output position on the human body can be loaded should be able to be supported. Bhaptics and Giggletech, along with others are planned but not stabilized yet.

 - [VRCH Native](native.md): Most widely supported with easiest integration. No commercial options
 - Bhaptics (Soon) - Mainly figuring out portable bluetooth
 - GiggleTech (Soon) - this algorithm looks like a headache....
