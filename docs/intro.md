# Welcome


VRC Haptics is a project aimed at providing cheap, performant, and easy to use haptic solutions. Currently all efforts are focused on vibration based haptics due to it's accessibility and ease of integration. This allows for haptic solutions created with a few cents per output motor and a few dollar main board. As well as simple integration with existing platforms and protocols.

#### Warning:
This project is currently maintained by a single developer in spare time between doctors visits and health issues. As such this should currently be viewed as a work in progress. 

*Author's note:* My setup has served daily usage for over a year now without major hiccups, so it isn't without merit or testing. But the testing area is a subject size of 1. 


## Getting Started
Setting up haptics on an avatar and getting a device built from scratch can be daunting. So there are a few tools developed to help simplify most steps down to a simple button click.

 - [Haptic Manager](./)
 - [VRC Avatar Integration](./VRChat/avatar-integration.md#basic-integration): Give the Haptics Manager access to in-game data.

The VRC Haptics is a big project spanning a couple applications:
