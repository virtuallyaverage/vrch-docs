Currently all efforts are focused on vibration based haptics due to it\'s accessibility and ease of integration. This allows for haptic solutions created with a few cents per output motor and a few dollar main board. As well as simple integration with existing platforms and protocols.","sidebar":"docLink"},"manager/haptic-manager":{"id":"manager/haptic-manager","title":"Manager App","description":"This is the main application for the whole haptics project. It is a required component to funnel the data from VRChat into our haptic devices.
